# Kitsune_Repository_Template

Welcome to this Kitsune Lab Project!

We appreciate so much if you use our work!
If you find any problem with this project please report it on the Project's GitHub page.
If you have any idea or feature request you can submit it on GitHub too.

We create our codes with <3

To use the include you can put include for only Emperor into your project, because it will autmatically add smlib too.
However if you have smlib already included, it will be ignored and Emperor will use that.
